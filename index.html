      <p>Hello everyone a pleasure to meet you. It has been a journey learning to code but I am starting to learn the fundamentals. Looking forward to this journey and being able to apply my practice to my career. This is my work in progress and will continue to develop as additional skills are obtained.</p>

      <p>A bit about myself, I have worked in finance most of my career, the majority of those positions have been working with data. Data has big impacts across all departments. From the easiest task of creating a project code, to summing up financials and reporting them to be able to make important business decisions. Data is key. I have worked with many different software programs both proprietary and open source databases. The most important information in all databases is the DATA!</p>

      <p>Working with various reporting tools has kept me up to date with what is occurring in the backend of these software databases and that has given me the ability to acquire, manipulate, and report on data. I enjoy knowing the business fundamentals, so that the data in which I am reporting has important business decisions. My curiosity allows me to dig further into resolving and exploring additional resources to improve reporting and make over all business decisions.</p>
